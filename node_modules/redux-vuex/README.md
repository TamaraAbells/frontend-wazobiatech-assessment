# redux-vuex

[Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) bindings for [VueJS](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) inspired by [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex).

## First things first

### Why don't you use vuex instead?

Redux and vuex are really hard to compare. Vuex is a state management pattern that clearly defines each subject of the state lifecycle. For most of the projects this helps a lot structuring your application but it also leaves a large architectural footprint.

Redux on the other hand is very adaptable to different scenarios giving you the ability to customize everything around state management like handling side effects (see [redux-effects](https://github.com/redux-effects/redux-effects), [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) or [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)) or even adapting full application flows like [rematch](https://github.com/rematch/rematch).

### Yay, yet another redux lib for VueJS

Valid point, it seems the needs for integrating with redux is strong. So depending on your requirements you may want to use:

- [vuejs-redux](https://github.com/titouancreach/vuejs-redux) if you want provider bindings like react-redux
- [vdeux](https://gitlab.com/citygro/vdeux) if you want a different kind of component bindings
- [revue](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/revue) also for nice store bindings but unfortunately its dead :(

## Installation

`redux-vuex` is written in pure es6 and only has dependencies to the beautiful crafted packages [get-value](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/get-value) and [set-value](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/set-value)

### Get the Package

```
npm i redux-vuex // yarn add redux-vuex
```

### Connect it to your Vue application

```javascript
import Vue from "vue";
import { createStore } from "redux";
import { connect } from "redux-vuex";

import { reducers, actions } from "./store";

const store = createStore(reducers);

connect({
  Vue,
  store,
  actions, // optional
  binding // optional: public store binding on vue instance (by default 'store')
});
```

## Usage

`redux-vuex` is focused on simplifying the access to the redux state and bind state changes to the vue instance in an efficient way.

### mapState

To assign state with ease to your component `mapState` needs to be used. It has two different signatures, depending on your component needs:

#### Automatic

If you want a 1:1 relationship between your redux store's state property names and your vue component's data then pass the names of these properties from redux as string arguments to `mapState`:

```javascript
import { mapState } from "redux-vuex";

export default {
  name: "My Vue Component",
  data: mapState("users", "todos") // maps state.users and state.todos to data.users and data.todos
};
```

#### Custom `data` property names

Alternatively, if you provide an object to mapState you can specify data property names.

```javascript
import { mapState } from "redux-vuex";

export default {
  name: "My Vue Component",
  data: mapState({
    users: "users", // maps state.users to data.users
    todoList: "todos" // maps state.todos to data.todoList
  })
};
```

#### Single property on data

You can pass a function that has access to the state object if you want to

```javascript
import { mapState } from "redux-vuex";

export default {
  name: "My Vue Component",
  data: mapState({
    state: state => ({ todoList: state.todos, users: state.users }) // maps state.todos to data.state.todoList and state.users to data.state.users
  })
};
```

You can use the last two methods together like so

```javascript
import { mapState } from "redux-vuex";

export default {
  name: "My Vue Component",
  data: mapState({
    users: "users", // maps state.users to data.users
    todoList: state => state.todos // maps state.todos to data.todoList
  })
};
```

#### Additional Data Attributes

In case you need to define additional data attributes outside of redux you need to use the component pre bound `mapState`:

```javascript
export default {
  name: "My Vue Component",
  data() {
    return {
      outsideOfRedux: true,
      ...this.mapState({
        todoList: "todos" //maps state.todos to data.todoList
      })
    };
  }
};
```

Note: using the object notation gives you the ability to use [store selectors](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/blob/b3f1c1699293ee7d0f185c24ea45957ff865bfca/examples/shopping-cart/reducers/index.js#L10-L37).

### mapActions

For a more convenient action dispatching `mapActions` can be used. To use this helper you need to pass in the actions in the `connect` function (see above):

```javascript
const actions = {
  foo: payload => {
    type: 'FOO', payload
  },

  bar: () => {
    type: 'BAR', payload: { bar: 'baz' }
  }
}
```

```javascript
import { mapActions } from "redux-vuex";

export default {
  name: "My Vue component",
  methods: mapActions("foo", "bar"), // creates scoped functions for foo and bar action
  mounted() {
    this.foo("baz"); // will dispatch { type: 'FOO', payload: 'baz' }
  }
};
```

If you need to dispatch multiple actions in one method (or want to assign different names), use the object notation:

```javascript
import { mapActions } from "redux-vuex";

export default {
  name: "My Vue component",
  methods: mapActions({
    baz: ({ dispatch, actions }, arg1, arg2) => {
      dispatch(actions.foo(arg2));
      dispatch(actions.bar());
    }
  }),
  mounted() {
    this.baz("foo", "bar"); // will dispatch foo and bar actions
  }
};
```

If you need to define your own methods, you still can use the spread operator:

```javascript
import { mapActions } from "redux-vuex";

export default {
  name: "My Vue component",
  methods: {
    ...mapActions("baz"),
    foo() {
      // do something
    }
  }
};
```

### store

Finally, if you need direct access to the store, each component has a binding to the store assigned:

```javascript
export default {
  name: "My Vue component",
  mounted() {
    this.store.subscribe(() => {
      console.log(this.store.getState());
    });

    this.store.dispatch({
      type: "foo",
      payload: "bar"
    });
  }
};
```

## How it works

- `mapState` creates a state binding on the component called `REDUX_VUEX_BINDINGS`
- Each Vue Component with bindings creates a store subscription
- On each state change all bindings are evaluated and update the assigned data attributes
- Only the mapped properties are retrieved from store and setted

## Caveats

- Can't use computed values like in vuex, vuex can bind to it's reactive state, for redux that's not efficiently possible
- Accessing other mapped values in custom getters does not work on initial cycle
